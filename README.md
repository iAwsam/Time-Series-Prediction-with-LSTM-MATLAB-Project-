# Time Series Prediction with LSTM (MATLAB Project)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network in MATLAB to perform time series prediction. The network is trained on randomly generated sine and cosine wave sequences.

The goal is to predict the next time steps in these sequences, testing the model’s ability to learn and generalize on periodic time series data.

## Features

- Generation of random sine and cosine sequences with random frequency and phase
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- LSTM network architecture for sequence learning
- Training and evaluation of the network using MATLAB’s Neural Network Toolbox
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual sequences

## Tools and Libraries

- MATLAB
- Neural Network Toolbox
- LSTM Layer
- Regression Layer

## How to Run

1. Open `lstm_prediction.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script to:
    - Generate training data
    - Define and train LSTM model
    - Predict on new test data
    - Plot results

## Visualization Example

The script will generate a plot showing actual vs. predicted sine/cosine waves.
